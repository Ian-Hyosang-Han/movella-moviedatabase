- Focused on user experience with thoughtful UI decisions like hover states, animations, and fallback content

## ✨ Personal Note
This project represents my growing passion for combining clean design with functional code.
I took special care in every detail — from dynamic movie genres and runtime formatting to accessible interactions and responsive layout.
Movella is more than a movie database; it’s my learning journey turned into an experience.
